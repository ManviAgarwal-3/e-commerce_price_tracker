This web app allows users to track product prices from e-commerce sites by entering the product name. It triggers a UiPath automation to fetch the current prices and displays the results directly in the app. Users also have the option to download the price data in an Excel file or receive an email notification with the price information.

## Features
- **Streamlit UI**: User-friendly interface for entering product names.
- **Price Tracking**: Automates the process of fetching product prices from e-commerce websites using UiPath.
- **Downloadable Excel Data**: Users can download the tracked prices as an Excel file.
- **Email Notifications**: Users can choose to receive price information via email (to be implemented).


## Improvements Needed

- **Mail Automation**: The UiPath XAML file needs to be updated to include an email notification feature that sends the tracked price information to the user.
- **Enhanced E-commerce Scraping**: The price tracker currently supports Amazon; additional support for other e-commerce platforms like Flipkart or eBay could be implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling in the UiPath automation and Streamlit UI to ensure smoother user experience.


Any suggestions or improvements to the project are welcome!
